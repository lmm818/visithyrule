        Since the calamity, Hyrule operates a little differently from other
        countries. There are monsters lurking about the land, sometimes in
        encampments. Due to that, we have consulted famous Hylian investigative
        journalist Traysi to create a list of important tips to keep your
        vacation safe, fun, and relaxed.

        Hi there! My name is Traysi, author of the famous #1 best-seller <i>Rumor
        Mill</i>. During my research in creating <i>Rumor Mill</i>, I traveled all over
        Hyrule. I learned and got used to a lot of different things, some were
        for my survival and others just neat tricks. Here are my top 10 tips for
        navigating this beautiful country.
        <br><br>
        	★ Bring plenty of food to eat, pen and paper to draw or write about
        your travels, and an attitude for an adventure! Being mentally and
        physically prepared for a trip makes it go that much more smoothly.
        <br><br>
        	★ I recommend an insulated bag for food which makes sure the weather
        does not spoil it.
        <br><br>
        	★ Make sure to carry bananas at all times. Some people who look like
        travelers are actually part of the Yiga Clan. They will go away if you
        offer them a banana or two because it's their favorite snack!
        <br><br>
        	★ If you spot black and pink goo, do not touch it! Trust me, it hurts
        to touch and it is not a fun time.
        <br><br>
        	★ If you see a monster, pause, and let it walk by. If it spotted you,
        run to the nearest stable! If it gets to you, be prepared to give up
        some meals you’ve packed.
        <br><br>
        	★ Stay away from Hyrule Castle and its immediate surrounding areas
        unaccompanied. You will not make it out.
        <br><br>
        	★ Make sure to purchase Goron Spice from Goron City, it makes for the
        best flavoring in dishes.
        <br><br>
        	★ If you will be traveling a lot, I recommend renting a horse from our
        many stables.
        <br><br>
        	★ Elixirs will come in handy! It is ideal to keep a few different
        ready since you can use them even if you are full.
        <br><br>
        	★ Have fun! Be in the moment and enjoy what Hyrule has to offer with
        the people you love.
